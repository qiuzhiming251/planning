// unsigned.  Google2 code therefore doesn't need a "uchar" type.

// scanning through memory for checksums or index searching). Don't use

// unsigned int, but our 64-bit architectures use the LP64 model
// (http://www.opengroup.org/public/tech/aspen/lp64_wp.htm), hence
// their ints are only 32 bits. We want to use the same fundamental
// type on all archs if possible to preserve *printf() compatability.

// and different size specifiers in format strings
